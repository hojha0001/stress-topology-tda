🔬 Problem Framing

“Stress is a dynamic physiological phenomenon, not a static label. Traditional ML models collapse this complexity.”

🧪 Hypothesis

“Latent stress states and recovery dynamics can be discovered by analyzing the shape and connectivity of biometric time-series data.”

⚙️ Method

No labels used

No thresholds used

No stress score predicted

Only structure discovery

📊 Results

Identified stable and transitional physiological states

Observed recurrent topological loops

Captured stress-recovery bridges ignored by classifiers

🚀 Contribution

“This project demonstrates how Topological Data Analysis can uncover clinically and behaviorally meaningful stress patterns without supervision.”
